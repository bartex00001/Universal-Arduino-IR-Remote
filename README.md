# Universal Arduino IR Remote

A project with a goal of creating an universal, programmable IR remote using arduino. Such device could be used as a replacement for a normal remote, or as a *'super'* remote for controlling multiple devices.

## Motivation

To turn on TV and ampli-tuner I need to use two remotes and, since I'm lazy, I decided that creating a universal remote would be a good idea.  
One additional feature that I find lacking in remotes is the ability to controll volume with a physical dial from the remote, thus it'll be available here.
